                <p class='findaharp-longDesc'>Only 6 years old and fully levered with Rees levers. The perfect travel or therapy harp. It’s got a small dent in the column and some surface cracks by some of the tuning pegs (I’ve checked with the builder and another harp maker and they say it’s in a safe location and with the repair I made the harp will last. Photos available). Asking $1100 usd. Located in northern Utah, willing to ship at buyers expense.</p>
