            <h2>About Tisha Murvihill</h2>
            <p>“Magical,” “Superb,” “Virtuoso,” “Outstanding”; these are the words newspapers such as the Calgary
                Herald and the Miami Herald have used to describe award-winning harpist Tisha Murvihill, Principal
                Harpist of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra.

                <br><br>In addition to her duties with the CPO, Ms. Murvihill has recorded three solo harp CDs to great
                acclaim. Her debut recording, If Brahms Wrote for Harp, was reviewed as “…a stunning presentation of
                the work of Johannes Brahms...” (HarpColumn, January ‘04). Her second CD, A Quiet Afternoon:
                Inspirational Songs for Harp, was awarded the “2009 Instrumental Album of the Year” Covenant Award by
                the Gospel Music Association of Canada, and she is very excited about her third CD, Come Just As You
                Are, which also received a Covenant Award nomination.

                <br><br>In 2005, the World Harp Congress honoured Ms. Murvihill with an invitation to Ireland to give a
                lecture-recital featuring her performance and transcriptions of Brahms’ music. She can often be heard
                on radio stations all over North America including stations in Pittsburgh, St. Louis, San Francisco,
                Minneapolis, and Canada. She has been the featured soloist with numerous groups including the Calgary
                Philharmonic Orchestra and the New World Symphony.

                <br><br>Prior to moving to Calgary, Ms. Murvihill spent three years with the New World Symphony in
                Miami, Florida under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas. There, she was twice selected to represent
                the orchestra at international fund raising events in Monte Carlo and received special mention on the
                New World Symphony’s CD release Defining Dahl: The Music of Ingolf Dahl for a solo which the Miami
                Herald called “sterling.”

                <br><br>Ms. Murvihill holds a Master’s Degree in harp performance from Indiana University where she
                studied under Distinguished Professor Susann McDonald and won the prestigious concerto competition.
