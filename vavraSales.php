                <p class='findaharp-longDesc'>Beautiful, rich, sounds emanate from this small harp. The tone wood qualities of the African Mahogany (Sapele) give it a rich and resonant voice with volume that compares to larger harps. The luster comes from the fine hand rubbed finish. The hand-carved Celtic scroll vines along the neck, pillar, and sides. It is strung with 26 wire strings, C3 to G6. Its about 32" tall, 25" deep, 13" wide and weighs about 13#. Can be fitted with sharping levers for semitone control.<br/><br/>The Universal levers shown in the photo have been removed (didn't like them) and can be replaced with Rees levers for an additional $208.00.</p>
