                    <div>The ElectroAcoustic harp is for performance harpists who want the flexibility of both an acoustic and an amplified harp, there is Lyon & Healy’s Style 2000 Electroacoustic harp. The electroacoustic harp produces sound through the use of transducers on each of the harp's strings. The result of this technology is an amplified harp which emits a reproduction of an acoustic sound in its natural state-the classic Lyon & Healy sound.</div>

                        <li>~ N.B. It is a well-known fact that the LH harps in the 3000s range are the best era of LH harp construction. Harps with these serial numbers are highly coveted for their sound and superb mechanism. This was the “golden era” of harp building by LH.</li>
                        <li>~ Purchased by Vixen Harps in the summer of 2004, this harp was sent to PRD from IN (where it originated) to be totally rebuilt, excluding the neck.</li>
                        <li>~ This harp has been totally rebuilt by PRD (Pat Dougal) of Joliet, IL. It received a new base, new soundboard, new reriveting, and a new bronzing.</li>
                        <li>~ This harp was sent back to Ottawa in 2004, and resent back to PRD for further work, such as new neck, bronzing and more touch-up work.</li>
                        <li>~ This harp has been in Ottawa since and rarely used. It was moved only once to play in Church and stayed at home since that date.</li>
