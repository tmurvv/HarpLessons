        <h4>Qualifications</h4>
        <p>I have a Master's degree in Music Performance from Indiana University School of Music under
            Distinguished Professor Susann McDonald. I have been the Principal Harpist of the <a href="https://www.calgaryphil.com" target="_blank">
                Calgary Philharmonic
                Orchestra
            </a> since 1995 and have been teaching privately for many years. </p>

        <h4>Teaching Philosophy</h4>
        <p>I suppose the best way to describe my teaching style is relaxed and easy-going. I want the harp to be
            fun for you! At the same time, I want you to feel that you are progressing and accomplishing your
            goals. If you want me to prepare you for a career as a professional harpist, I am happy to work with
            you on that. However, if you simply want to play at home for yourself and your friends, we can
            make that happen. Email <a href="mailto:harp@harptisha.com">harp@harptisha.com</a> for more info.</p>
