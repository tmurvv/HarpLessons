Qualifications




I have a Master's degree in Music Performance from Indiana University School of Music under Distinguished Professor Susann McDonald. I have been the Principal Harpist of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra since 1995 and have been teaching privately for many years.





Teaching Philosophy


I suppose the best way to describe my teaching style is relaxed and easy-going. I want the harp to be fun for you! At the same time, I want you to feel that you are progressing and accomplishing your goals. If you want me to prepare you for a career as a professional harpist, I am happy to work with you on that. However, if you simply want to play at home for yourself and your friends, we can make that happen. Email harp@harptisha.com for more info.
